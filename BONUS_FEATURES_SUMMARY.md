## 🧠 BONUS FEATURE 1: Focus Mode

### What It Does

- **Task Lock**: Locks the screen to a single task during focus mode
- **Pause/Resume**: Full control over timer with pause and resume functionality
- **Voice Integration**: Announces focus mode start and completion
- **Badge System**: Awards "💎 Diamond Focus" badge for using focus mode

### How It Works

1. **Activation**: Click "🎯 Focus Mode" button on idle screen
2. **Timer Display**: Large countdown timer with color-coded status
   - Green: >10 minutes remaining
   - Orange: 5-10 minutes remaining
   - Red: <5 minutes remaining
3. **Controls**: Pause/Resume and End Focus buttons
4. **Completion**: Voice announcement and popup when timer ends

### Code Implementation

```python
# Focus Mode Methods
def start_focus_mode(self, task):
    """Start focus mode with Pomodoro timer for a specific task."""
    self.focus_mode = True
    self.focus_task = task
    self.pomodoro_start_time = time.time()
    self.pomodoro_timer = 25 * 60  # 25 minutes
    # ... voice announcement

def get_pomodoro_time_remaining(self):
    """Get remaining time in Pomodoro timer."""
    # ... time calculation logic

def check_pomodoro_completion(self):
    """Check if Pomodoro timer is complete."""
    # ... completion handling
```

## 👁️‍🗨️ BONUS FEATURE 2: Distraction Alerts

### What It Does

- **Inactivity Detection**: Monitors mouse/keyboard interaction
- **Smart Thresholds**: 30-second inactivity triggers warning
- **Visual Alerts**: Full-screen distraction warning with countdown
- **Voice Integration**: Speaks distraction alert message
- **Badge System**: Awards "🛡️ Distraction Shield" badge for handling distractions

### How It Works

1. **Monitoring**: Tracks last interaction time continuously
2. **Detection**: Triggers after 30 seconds of inactivity
3. **Warning Screen**: Shows distraction alert with time inactive
4. **Dismissal**: "I'm Back!" button to dismiss and resume
5. **Recovery**: Automatically returns to idle screen after 5 seconds

### Code Implementation

```python
# Distraction Alert Methods
def update_interaction_time(self):
    """Update the last interaction time."""
    self.last_interaction_time = time.time()

def check_distraction(self):
    """Check if user has been inactive for too long."""
    time_since_interaction = time.time() - self.last_interaction_time
    if time_since_interaction > self.distraction_threshold:
        # ... trigger distraction warning

def dismiss_distraction_warning(self):
    """Dismiss the distraction warning."""
    # ... award badge and return to idle
```
